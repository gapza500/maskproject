# AirMonitor Sync Example (Stub)

This folder will collect sketches and docs for the AirMonitor C6 cloud sync demo:

- SEN66 particulate + environmental readings
- MAX17048 battery guard integration
- FlashLogger append/predicate/export flow
- Upload helper to cloud HTTP API
- Optional BLE fallback
- Visualization scripts (CSV charts)

Placeholder for now.
